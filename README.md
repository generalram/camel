CAMEL: Client and Matter Electronic Litigation System

Prototype of a search engine for law firms to search client and mater information.

Uses a MS-Access database, can be modified to use a different database

Just a MVC Prototype written in Visual BASIC 6.0

Can be developed into a full stack system, when I worked for a law firm I wrote a more complex version
and web apps to do the same thing. This is starting over from scratch.


This is a complete and totally written from scratch project. It does not use code from CMSOpen, Solution 6, or other legal practice management software out there that is the copyright of different corporations. It is a work in progress done on my spare time. It is currently under an open source license and submitted to Github at http://github.com/generalram/camel/ if you got this code from a place other than Github.

Goals are to search client and matter information into a listview control, add the ability to copy data to Word templates like an Invoice or Check Request, add in Data Entry forms to add and edit and delete data, and possibly make a web version in ASP or PHP later on.

Of course I have plans to develop the same app in more modern programming languages, but many law firms are still using older technology so this is a legacy Windows project for now. It should be able to be run from Windows 95 to Windows XP, not sure about Vista, 7, 8.X, and 10 that may require Visual Studio 2013 instead of Visual Studio 6.
