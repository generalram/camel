CAMEL: Client and Matter Electronic Litigation System

Prototype of a search engine for law firms to search client and mater information.

Uses a MS-Access database, can be modified to use a different database

Just a MVC Prototype written in Visual BASIC 6.0

Can be developed into a full stack system, when I worked for a law firm I wrote a more complex version
and web apps to do the same thing. This is starting over from scratch.
